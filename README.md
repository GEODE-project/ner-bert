# Token classification with BERT-like models

This repository contains code for token classification with BERT-like models. 

- [train_camembert_span_classification.ipynb](train_camembert_span_classification.ipynb): CamemBERT fine-tuning for span classification.
- [evaluate_camembert_span_classification.ipynb](evaluate_camembert_span_classification.ipynb): Evaluation.
- [camembert_span_classification.ipynb](camembert_span_classification.ipynb): Usage examples.


The fine-tuned GeoEDdA CamemBERT model is available on the HuggingFace Hub: [https://huggingface.co/GEODE/](https://huggingface.co/GEODE/) ðŸ¤—

For training and evaluation we used the GeoEDdA dataset available also on HuggingFace:
